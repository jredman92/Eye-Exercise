# Eye-Exercise

Description: This project was designed to show how to use javaScript code to make something follow your cursor. In this example, I'm showing the eyes that I created in CSS follow the mouse.

How to run: Copy all the files in the repository. Open the html file up in your browser.

Future Improvements: I plan on making a nose and mouse that will do different actions based on where the cursor is
